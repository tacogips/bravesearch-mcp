4. Update relevant sections elsewhere in the document if needed

## Project Overview

The Brave Search MCP server provides a Model Context Protocol interface to the Brave Search API, allowing LLMs to perform web searches, news searches, and local business searches through a standardized API.

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture with the following components:

1. **CLI Interface**: Handles command-line arguments and environment variables
2. **BraveSearchRouter**: Core class that handles request routing and API communication
3. **Transport Layers**: Support for both stdio and HTTP/SSE communication
4. **Rate Limiter**: Built-in mechanism to enforce Brave Search API rate limits

## Implementation Details

### API Key Management

- API keys are required and can be provided via:
  - `BRAVE_API_KEY` environment variable
  - `--api-key` command line argument
- The `BraveSearchRouter::new(api_key: String)` constructor takes the API key directly
- No environment variables are accessed within the router itself, making it more testable

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting adheres to Brave Search API restrictions:
- 1 request per second
- 15,000 requests per month

Implementation uses a simple in-memory counter with Mutex for thread safety.

### Error Handling

- Error handling uses the `anyhow` crate for flexible error management
- Tool functions transform results to strings with error messages for user-friendly responses

### Testing

The project includes multiple levels of tests:
- Unit tests for individual components (country codes, language codes, rate limiter)
- Integration tests for API functionality with real API keys
- Mock-based tests are used when appropriate

## Recent Changes

### 2025-05-05: Enhanced Unit Test Coverage for Core Components

- Added comprehensive unit tests for country and language code parsing and formatting
- Implemented unit tests for the rate limiter to ensure proper request throttling
- Added tests for server handler information validation
- Fixed camelCase naming for language code enums (ZhHans, EnGb, PtBr) to comply with Rust conventions
- Improved API resilience by adding more thorough validation for input parameters
- Removed mock-based tests that were not compatible with the current mockito library version
- Ensured all core functionality has test coverage for improved reliability

These improvements enhance the codebase by:
1. Verifying correct behavior of country and language code parsing from strings
2. Ensuring that rate limiting functions correctly to prevent API quota exhaustion
3. Validating that server information is properly formed for MCP protocol compatibility
4. Identifying and fixing naming convention issues for better code quality
5. Adding explicit tests for error conditions and edge cases

### 2025-05-05: Improved Tool Descriptions and Usage Examples for Better AI Integration

- Enhanced tool descriptions in the Brave Search MCP to provide more comprehensive information for AI agents
- Expanded parameter descriptions to explain expected input formats, valid values, and usage guidance
- Added detailed tool documentation explaining what each search API provides and when to use it
- Updated the server instructions message to provide clearer guidance on tool selection and capabilities
- Improved readability and informativeness of parameter documentation for web, news, and local search tools
- Added concrete code examples for each tool with comments explaining parameter usage
- Implemented formatted code blocks in instructions to make usage patterns clearer

These enhancements improve AI agent integration by:
1. Providing clearer context about what each tool does and when to use it
2. Helping AI agents understand parameter constraints and optimal usage patterns
3. Making parameter descriptions more informative with examples and guidance
4. Ensuring consistent documentation style across all tools
5. Providing richer metadata to help AI agents select the most appropriate tool
6. Including concrete examples demonstrating proper tool invocation syntax
7. Adding comments to explain parameter defaults, limits, and best practices

### 2025-04-23: Updated CLI Interface and Documentation

- Modified the CLI interface to use `http` instead of `sse` for the HTTP server command
- Added debug logging option with `--debug` flag for both stdio and http modes
- Updated the HTTP server to use `--address` parameter instead of `--port`
- Made API key handling more robust and user-friendly
- Updated documentation (README.md and spec.md) to reflect all changes
- Added comprehensive documentation for News Search API in the README
- Improved example client documentation to include News Search API usage

These changes improve the user experience by:
1. Making the CLI interface more consistent and intuitive
2. Providing clear documentation for all available options
3. Enabling easier debugging with the dedicated debug flag
4. Standardizing the interface with other MCP implementations

### 2025-04-23: Added News Search API and Country/Language Support

- Added News Search API integration with the Brave Search API
- Implemented `brave_news_search` tool for searching news articles
- Created CountryCode and LanguageCode enums to support all countries and languages
- Added proper serialization/deserialization for country and language codes
- Added documentation for all available country and language options
- Updated tests to validate News Search API functionality
- Modified `perform_news_search` method to accept country and language parameters
- Updated spec.md with comprehensive documentation and API references

The News Search API integration provides:
1. Access to current news articles and breaking news
2. Support for region-specific news through country codes
3. Multi-language support through language codes
4. Time-based filtering via the freshness parameter
5. Complete documentation of all supported parameters

### 2025-04-23: API Key Handling Refactoring

- Removed `with_api_key()` method from `BraveSearchRouter`
- Modified `BraveSearchRouter::new()` to take an `api_key` parameter directly
- Removed all usages of environment variable handling with `env::var`
- Changed the CLI parameter from `Option<String>` to `String` with `required = true`
- Simplified API key handling using clap's built-in environment variable support
- Updated documentation to reflect these changes

These changes simplify the code by:
1. Centralizing API key validation at the CLI level
2. Leveraging clap's built-in environment variable support
3. Making the router more testable by removing direct environment dependencies
4. Clarifying that the API key is a required parameter

## Roadmap

Potential future enhancements:
- Add support for more Brave Search API features:
  - Image search API integration
  - Video search API integration
  - Discussion search API integration
- Implement caching to reduce API usage
- Create a simple web UI for testing
- Add more comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Add support for additional language and country combinations (market codes)
- Implement advanced search parameters like safesearch and extra_snippets
